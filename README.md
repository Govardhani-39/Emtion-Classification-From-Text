# Emtion-Classification-From-Text
Introduction
Understanding human emotions in textual content is critical for applications in customer feedback analysis, chatbot development, sentiment analysis, and social media monitoring. Traditional methods struggle with context understanding, making machine learning-based approaches more effective. This project aims to build an automated emotion classification system using NLP techniques and classification algorithms.

Algorithm
The project follows these key steps:

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning text, removing stopwords, tokenization
Feature Extraction – Converting text into numerical data using TF-IDF
Model Selection – Implementing classifiers like Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM
Training & Testing – Splitting data, training models, and evaluating performance
Prediction & Evaluation – Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Process for Algorithm
Data Collection – Collect text data labeled with emotions
Data Preprocessing – Text cleaning, removing stopwords, stemming, and tokenization
Feature Engineering – Applying TF-IDF vectorization
Model Training – Training models using supervised learning
Evaluation – Comparing model performance using classification reports and confusion matrices
Deployment – Using the best-performing model for real-world text emotion classification
Output (Expected Results)
Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Score to evaluate performance
Example Predictions:
Input: "I am so happy today!" → Predicted Emotion: Happy
Input: "I feel so down and lost." → Predicted Emotion: Sad
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates emotion classification from text using machine learning models. By applying TF-IDF vectorization and classifiers like Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression, we achieved accurate emotion detection. Future improvements can include deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) for better contextual understanding and improved accuracy.
